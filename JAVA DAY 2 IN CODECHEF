/* There is a contest containing 2 problems A and B.2 strong participants P and Q participated in the contest and solved both the problems.
P made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants P1,P2 respectively while 
Q made AC submissions on problems A and B at time instants Q1,Q2.It is given that the time penalty is the minimum time instant at which a participant has solved both the problems. Also the participant with the lower time penalty will have a better rank.

Determine which participant got the better rank or if there is a TIE. */
